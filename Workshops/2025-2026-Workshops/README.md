# IEEE St. Mary’s University Workshops Code Library – 2025–2026

Welcome to the official code collection for the **IEEE Student Chapter at St. Mary’s University** for the 2025–2026 academic year.  
This repository section collects code from our hands-on workshops to support learning and experimentation.  

Here you’ll find:
- **Starter code** — simplified templates for students to begin with.  
- **Complete code** — fully working examples, sometimes adapted from or inspired by external projects.  
- **External contributions** — when we borrow or adapt code under open-source licenses, we clearly note the source and keep the license files intact.

## 🤝 Contributing

Members are welcome to add starter or complete workshop code.  
When including outside projects:
1. Verify the code has a permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD).  
2. Copy the original LICENSE file into the workshop folder.  
3. Add an attribution line in the folder’s README pointing to the source repository.  
4. Update the [Borrowed Code Index](../../docs/Borrowed-Code-Index.md).  

This keeps us compliant and respectful of open-source authors.
