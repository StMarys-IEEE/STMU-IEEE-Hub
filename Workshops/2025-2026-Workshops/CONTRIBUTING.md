# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to the IEEE St. Mary’s University Workshops repo!

### Adding New Code
- Place all new workshop code inside `workshops/<workshop-name>/`.
- Include both a `starter/` (simplified) and `complete/` (finished) version if possible.

### Using External Code
- Only include code that has a permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD).
- Always copy the original `LICENSE` file into the workshop folder.
- Add a short attribution line in the folder’s `README.md` linking to the source repo.
- Do **not** copy code with “All Rights Reserved” or unknown licensing.

### Licensing
- All original IEEE workshop code is under the MIT License (see root `LICENSE`).
- Third-party code keeps its own license in the relevant folder.
