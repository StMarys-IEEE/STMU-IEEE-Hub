# Borrowed Code Index

This document tracks all external code borrowed or adapted in the **IEEE STMU Hub**.  
Every entry must include the source repository, license, and where it is used in this repo.  

---

## ðŸ“– Why This Matters
- Keeps us compliant with open-source licenses.  
- Gives credit to the original authors.  
- Makes it clear which parts of the repo are original vs. borrowed.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Add a New Entry

1. Confirm the codeâ€™s license is **permissive** (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD).  
2. Copy the original `LICENSE` file into the borrowed folder.  
3. Add an attribution line in that folderâ€™s `README.md`.  
4. Update this index by adding a new row to the table above with:  
   - Workshop name  
   - Source repository (with link)  
   - License type  
   - Location within this hub repo
